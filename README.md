# Where's Wally? (Photo Tagging Game)

This project is a photo tagging app that allows users to identify and locate characters in a given image. It provides an interactive interface where users can click on the photo to place a targeting box around the selected area and choose the character they think is located there.

The app integrates with a backend system to validate the user's selection, provide feedback, and track user performance. The backend integration includes a leaderboard feature where user scores are stored and retrieved from the backend.
